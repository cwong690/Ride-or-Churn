## Introduction

**Main Goal:** <br>
Predict if a ride-share user will churn (that is, not be active within the past 30 days). <br>

*Note: This info is sourced from a ride-sharing company (Company X) and is interested in predicting rider retention*

**Evaluation:**<br>
The evaluation of our model will be based on Accuracy, Recall, and Precision.<br>
